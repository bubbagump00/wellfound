1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,840
start recording here.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,450
All right,

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,650
so now I have to wait.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,750
We're talking.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,360
We have got to,

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,250
um you got to the point where we're starting to talk about 

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,760
about your children.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,250
You talked a little bit about where you grew up.

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,340
And then the point in your life where you were starting to have children.

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,160
You mentioned that you had.

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,300
He had three of them at the time,

12
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,740
and then another one came a little bit later.

13
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,540
So that's where you want.

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,100
Yeah.

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,780
I think that's a good place to start,

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,240
I think.

17
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:47,850
Oh,

18
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,850
when they first moved to Gunderson,

19
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,040
it was in the in the fall.

20
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,080
And then my oldest,

21
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,670
my first boy was born in September,

22
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,240
and then we had to make it through that winter.

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,870
It was really,

24
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,190
really cold at winner.

25
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,690
But he did all right.

26
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,520
And my dad and my granddad were so excited because we 

27
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,830
had a boy and,

28
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,560
uh so But we did all right.

29
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,760
And then the second year,

30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,810
we I think it was a cord.

31
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,120
The end of the second year.

32
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,800
We way build a house and moved in out of the 

33
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:37,360
trailer.

34
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,150
I have no idea what happened to the trailer.

35
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:41,570
But anyway,

36
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,090
we,

37
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,450
uh we will did to this house,

38
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,860
and that was it was kind of needed.

39
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,760
It was a one bedroom to bedroom upstairs in a full 

40
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,440
mason,

41
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,320
which was made into an apartment which we,

42
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:55,840
uh,

43
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,710
we read it.

44
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,300
Finally.

45
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,010
But it was it was a pretty pretty neat.

46
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,260
The only problem with with it wasthe that 

47
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,320
the,

48
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:08,680
uh,

49
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,850
basement and the sewer system that when build in 

50
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,580
Gunnison was probably round the turn of the century 

51
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,180
and it was what they call open sewer.

52
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:26,550
And so and the water table get above the sewer,

53
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,180
their sewer,

54
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,010
it don't work,

55
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,820
Okay.

56
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:35,240
And so that's what happened in the spring because the snow would melt a lot 

57
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,690
of that.

58
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,090
Then,

59
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,520
at that point,

60
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,110
you got you got a real problem in the basement trying to get it to 

61
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,420
flush and all that,

62
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:44,790
but,

63
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,280
uh,

64
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,450
and it was a problem,

65
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,110
a lot.

66
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,090
And there was nothing they could do about it,

67
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,590
except to replace the whole sewer system,

68
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,940
which they probably haven't done yet.

69
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,880
I wouldn't I wouldn't think,

70
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,310
uh,

71
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,060
would.

72
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,650
Anyway,

73
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,130
we,

74
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,230
uh it turned out really well,

75
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,960
and I,

76
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:07,380
uh,

77
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,640
I brought a a wielding that 

78
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,820
had been used for trucks where it was 

79
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,010
Ah,

80
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,480
gas trucks.

81
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,250
Actually,

82
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,030
like,

83
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,880
uh,

84
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,140
you they call it Elfi Gas.

85
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,780
There we go.

86
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,710
L ve gas strokes and used this thing.

87
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,590
And so they wanted to sell the building,

88
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,570
and I bought that thing and then moved it down there on the back of our place.

89
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,540
So it was It was a big,

90
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,450
big building.

91
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,820
And eventually I made it into a shopping,

92
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,960
then into a business.

93
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,740
And we had all the repair business back there.

94
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,680
But anyway,

95
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,430
uh,

96
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,620
there was a kind of an adventure with that because I went up.

97
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,560
Thio didn't measure the building.

98
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,800
They told me what the two inches were.

99
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:16,355
So then I made a foundation and poured 

100
00:04:16,365 --> 00:04:17,155
concrete.

101
00:04:17,155 --> 00:04:19,525
Did that went So And,

102
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,315
uh Ah,

103
00:04:21,315 --> 00:04:21,825
I would do it.

104
00:04:21,825 --> 00:04:26,155
Infections and I would call ready mix,

105
00:04:26,155 --> 00:04:27,155
and they would cover.

106
00:04:27,295 --> 00:04:29,525
And I'd screed it and do it.

107
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:31,535
And then I'd make another section.

108
00:04:31,545 --> 00:04:34,185
So then then I moved about.

109
00:04:34,185 --> 00:04:35,665
They moved the building and well,

110
00:04:35,665 --> 00:04:39,765
the building was bigger than yeah,

111
00:04:40,485 --> 00:04:42,335
So it was hanging over Well,

112
00:04:42,455 --> 00:04:44,625
about 18 inches or so,

113
00:04:45,735 --> 00:04:47,045
which was really a problem.

114
00:04:47,055 --> 00:04:47,485
Yeah,

115
00:04:48,195 --> 00:04:53,165
but eventually was able to pour more concrete in there.

116
00:04:53,175 --> 00:04:54,115
Take care of that.

117
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,435
But it turned out okay.

118
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:57,985
And the building was a good one.

119
00:04:58,745 --> 00:05:03,635
And we made a shop that had big door because you two were trucks.

120
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,205
And,

121
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:05,645
uh,

122
00:05:05,785 --> 00:05:06,915
so that workout.

123
00:05:06,915 --> 00:05:07,165
Good.

124
00:05:07,165 --> 00:05:07,395
Well,

125
00:05:07,395 --> 00:05:08,055
anyway,

126
00:05:08,545 --> 00:05:09,545
my oldest son,

127
00:05:09,555 --> 00:05:11,955
then And then two years later,

128
00:05:11,955 --> 00:05:14,835
while then Robin Cane of daughter.

129
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,875
And then two years after that,

130
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:19,325
flint came,

131
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:22,895
So they were all over the same help.

132
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:24,485
Well,

133
00:05:24,485 --> 00:05:24,805
in,

134
00:05:24,815 --> 00:05:26,535
uh Ah.

135
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:28,435
Uh,

136
00:05:29,025 --> 00:05:29,605
why they,

137
00:05:31,225 --> 00:05:31,835
uh,

138
00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:36,325
Blaine got old enough where I have gone to school.

139
00:05:38,155 --> 00:05:39,145
You start school,

140
00:05:39,145 --> 00:05:39,475
I guess,

141
00:05:39,475 --> 00:05:40,365
Was kindergarten.

142
00:05:40,365 --> 00:05:41,035
I fooled.

143
00:05:41,205 --> 00:05:42,055
And,

144
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:46,885
uh but it was allowed probably 

145
00:05:46,885 --> 00:05:49,235
about six blocks away at least.

146
00:05:52,175 --> 00:05:52,885
And rough it.

147
00:05:53,595 --> 00:05:54,595
But hey,

148
00:05:54,595 --> 00:05:57,255
would walk the school even in the winter.

149
00:05:57,255 --> 00:05:59,105
Time was kind of neat,

150
00:05:59,115 --> 00:05:59,415
you know?

151
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,085
I mean that the way they did things.

152
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:04,325
And so he started schooler,

153
00:06:05,315 --> 00:06:05,875
And,

154
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:06,135
uh,

155
00:06:06,145 --> 00:06:07,235
in the meantime,

156
00:06:08,495 --> 00:06:11,245
I got into Ah ah.

157
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,395
I was in the chamber of commerce business.

158
00:06:13,395 --> 00:06:16,208
And then I got into the ah,

159
00:06:16,218 --> 00:06:21,078
we had furniture and appliances on dhe 

160
00:06:21,358 --> 00:06:25,778
willing the storage and all that stuff on duh 

161
00:06:26,158 --> 00:06:28,698
sold a janitor supplies,

162
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:30,378
uh,

163
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,998
which is really a pretty good business because,

164
00:06:33,488 --> 00:06:33,828
well,

165
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:38,198
they had all these dude ranches and 

166
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,538
motels of stuff that we're coming in.

167
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:44,518
And so it was a great place to sell.

168
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:46,508
So janitor from Florida.

169
00:06:47,788 --> 00:06:51,028
So we got into all the business that we're doing pretty well.

170
00:06:51,028 --> 00:06:52,238
Got cash report,

171
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:53,628
uh,

172
00:06:53,638 --> 00:06:57,638
cash not support cash short.

173
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:02,768
And so I sold the business my part of business.

174
00:07:02,768 --> 00:07:04,618
And then I went back to college together,

175
00:07:04,618 --> 00:07:05,708
master degree,

176
00:07:06,588 --> 00:07:07,698
Because I heard that,

177
00:07:08,588 --> 00:07:09,048
uh,

178
00:07:09,058 --> 00:07:10,248
if we were a teacher,

179
00:07:10,248 --> 00:07:10,658
you'd,

180
00:07:10,668 --> 00:07:11,438
you know,

181
00:07:11,438 --> 00:07:12,858
you have the whole summer off,

182
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,528
so it sounds like a pretty good deal,

183
00:07:17,528 --> 00:07:18,128
you know,

184
00:07:18,888 --> 00:07:21,418
a friend of summer fishing.

185
00:07:21,418 --> 00:07:21,698
And,

186
00:07:22,758 --> 00:07:23,168
well,

187
00:07:23,168 --> 00:07:25,498
it never turned out that way.

188
00:07:26,388 --> 00:07:29,438
But that's that was my father's time.

189
00:07:30,758 --> 00:07:31,958
And eventually,

190
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:32,218
I,

191
00:07:32,228 --> 00:07:32,678
uh,

192
00:07:32,688 --> 00:07:35,078
and I work for the four service for a while.

193
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,068
But then then,

194
00:07:37,078 --> 00:07:37,638
uh,

195
00:07:37,888 --> 00:07:40,388
I graduated and I needed a job,

196
00:07:40,398 --> 00:07:42,368
so Ah,

197
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:45,838
I did got a job in Carlsbad,

198
00:07:45,838 --> 00:07:46,698
New Mexico.

199
00:07:47,358 --> 00:07:47,968
So anyway,

200
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,788
that we then we moved to Carl Bedwell.

201
00:07:51,688 --> 00:07:52,398
Uh,

202
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,838
and so were there one year on,

203
00:07:56,838 --> 00:07:58,618
then went to Roswell,

204
00:07:58,618 --> 00:07:59,408
New Mexico,

205
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:00,698
for several years.

206
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,998
For what's the New Mexico military?

207
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,288
Like a long story Short,

208
00:08:07,298 --> 00:08:07,628
right.

209
00:08:08,248 --> 00:08:08,588
Oh,

210
00:08:08,598 --> 00:08:08,978
my.

211
00:08:09,678 --> 00:08:12,188
All those three grew up nicely.

212
00:08:13,488 --> 00:08:14,068
And,

213
00:08:14,068 --> 00:08:16,983
uh and so the question is,

214
00:08:16,983 --> 00:08:19,003
what happened to the word they go on?

215
00:08:19,003 --> 00:08:19,173
Well,

216
00:08:19,173 --> 00:08:20,563
that we grow up.

217
00:08:21,443 --> 00:08:22,093
And of course,

218
00:08:22,093 --> 00:08:22,943
in the meantime,

219
00:08:22,943 --> 00:08:23,433
we have.

220
00:08:24,153 --> 00:08:24,633
Well,

221
00:08:24,653 --> 00:08:25,163
uh,

222
00:08:25,653 --> 00:08:29,763
we eventually went toe a Manhattan Kansas on Duh.

223
00:08:30,793 --> 00:08:33,383
And why Blaine,

224
00:08:33,383 --> 00:08:34,823
my oldest boy,

225
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,503
was in high school.

226
00:08:38,903 --> 00:08:39,473
Andi,

227
00:08:39,473 --> 00:08:40,883
He took up well,

228
00:08:41,823 --> 00:08:43,313
cross country running,

229
00:08:44,153 --> 00:08:44,463
okay.

230
00:08:45,183 --> 00:08:47,013
And did quite well.

231
00:08:47,013 --> 00:08:48,463
Then he got into that,

232
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:49,933
and,

233
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:50,283
uh,

234
00:08:50,903 --> 00:08:51,803
and hey,

235
00:08:51,813 --> 00:08:52,263

237
00:08:58,213 --> 00:08:58,953
Ah,

238
00:08:58,963 --> 00:08:59,083

239
00:08:59,083 --> 00:08:59,743
I'll run.

240
00:08:59,743 --> 00:09:00,123
Well,

241
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,573

244
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:07,353
Really?

245
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:09,003
Do you know what the time is?

246
00:09:09,013 --> 00:09:09,673
No,

247
00:09:09,673 --> 00:09:11,463
I don't have to look it up,

248
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:16,843
but of the reason that he has today if they don't run the mile anymore 

249
00:09:19,623 --> 00:09:20,763
Uh,

250
00:09:20,913 --> 00:09:21,463
yeah.

251
00:09:23,723 --> 00:09:24,563
So anyway,

252
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:28,363
he still has that record to this day and will forever.

253
00:09:30,413 --> 00:09:32,353
What did What did they substitute it with?

254
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:36,563
No,

255
00:09:36,573 --> 00:09:37,053
no,

256
00:09:37,053 --> 00:09:37,383
it's,

257
00:09:37,393 --> 00:09:38,003
uh,

258
00:09:38,013 --> 00:09:38,793
Kilometers.

259
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:39,323
Oh,

260
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:40,223
yeah.

261
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:43,133
They don't run the mile around Columbus.

262
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:45,483
Yeah.

263
00:09:45,553 --> 00:09:46,063
Uh huh.

264
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:48,083
So then he went down.

265
00:09:48,093 --> 00:09:49,583
You got Hey,

266
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,823

267
00:09:55,563 --> 00:09:56,203

268
00:09:56,203 --> 00:09:56,683
uh,

269
00:09:57,003 --> 00:09:58,133
you did pretty well,

270
00:09:58,133 --> 00:09:59,173
but they're you know,

271
00:09:59,173 --> 00:10:01,953
you get no matter how good you get there,

272
00:10:01,953 --> 00:10:03,003
somebody better.

273
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:07,973
And there were better ones evidently.

274
00:10:08,713 --> 00:10:12,363
But he did get a scholarship at Kansas State.

275
00:10:13,403 --> 00:10:13,893
Who,

276
00:10:13,893 --> 00:10:14,393
uh,

277
00:10:14,403 --> 00:10:14,713
you know,

278
00:10:14,713 --> 00:10:15,773
in the garage.

279
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:16,303
Well,

280
00:10:17,003 --> 00:10:17,923
hey,

281
00:10:17,923 --> 00:10:18,783
did all right,

282
00:10:18,783 --> 00:10:21,123
but we didn't do real well for them,

283
00:10:21,773 --> 00:10:22,873
but he had a scholar.

284
00:10:26,173 --> 00:10:27,073
Uh,

285
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,673
and so anyway,

286
00:10:29,673 --> 00:10:30,813
we're there for,

287
00:10:32,793 --> 00:10:33,383
I guess,

288
00:10:33,523 --> 00:10:34,913
seven or eight years 

289
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:38,633
on.

290
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:39,283
Duh.

291
00:10:39,523 --> 00:10:42,023
Robin was in the four H Club.

292
00:10:43,373 --> 00:10:45,683
She got in the end of that.

293
00:10:45,693 --> 00:10:49,313
That massive she?

294
00:10:50,773 --> 00:10:51,683
Well,

295
00:10:51,683 --> 00:10:53,003
she tried dogs.

296
00:10:53,143 --> 00:10:53,503
Okay,

297
00:10:53,883 --> 00:10:55,043
on Duh.

298
00:10:55,053 --> 00:10:58,093
What could we were in town on?

299
00:10:58,203 --> 00:10:59,683
So somebody said,

300
00:11:00,073 --> 00:11:03,443
Are you ought to try Dog ran from really special ones.

301
00:11:04,573 --> 00:11:05,333
So anyway,

302
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,083
she got three dogs.

303
00:11:09,163 --> 00:11:10,673
It was awful on,

304
00:11:10,723 --> 00:11:11,183
uh,

305
00:11:16,493 --> 00:11:18,913
long story behind that.

306
00:11:18,923 --> 00:11:23,603
We have built a There was a tool shed.

307
00:11:23,603 --> 00:11:23,993
Black.

308
00:11:23,993 --> 00:11:28,743
They're in the back with a big old house that had been built 

309
00:11:28,743 --> 00:11:31,483
around 18 mighty.

310
00:11:31,493 --> 00:11:32,513
I guess they're on.

311
00:11:33,473 --> 00:11:35,493
It was in a maybe a little later,

312
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,013
but it had a,

313
00:11:37,673 --> 00:11:38,293
um,

314
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,583
carriage house.

315
00:11:41,413 --> 00:11:46,023
A two story carriage house on the back or the You know,

316
00:11:46,103 --> 00:11:47,843
it had two doors.

317
00:11:47,853 --> 00:11:51,113
Have one of the front one of the back and run your carriage in there.

318
00:11:51,573 --> 00:11:56,053
And then there was a place where you could take the horse out and then on the side,

319
00:11:56,273 --> 00:11:56,963
you know,

320
00:11:58,283 --> 00:11:59,503
that's when he did things.

321
00:12:01,123 --> 00:12:01,663
Well,

322
00:12:01,903 --> 00:12:02,333
anyway,

323
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:07,213
we also have tools shared and my folks has been really nice.

324
00:12:07,573 --> 00:12:12,033
They thought because my dad had been in the hatchery,

325
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:16,423
but just one time and he thought my youngest boy off Thio 

326
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:22,290
know about quickens and how that happens all that.

327
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,190
So we gave him an incubator.

328
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,340
The thing about film leg,

329
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,750
I remember very much.

330
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,350
A lot of what?

331
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,210
Their eggs in there.

332
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:36,340
And then it would hold the temperature and shared up.

333
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,590
One of them hatched.

334
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,190
Look.

335
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,690
And it was a rooster,

336
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,320
Of course.

337
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,000
So,

338
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,420
anyway,

339
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,430
when that was in,

340
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,480
when we were in Arizona as well.

341
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,530
In the meantime,

342
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,140
our shipping of we had Ah,

343
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,490
I took a job in,

344
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:53,990
uh,

345
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,100
in New Mexico.

346
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,090
And then Then I went back to graduate school in in Arizona 

347
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,150
and,

348
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:01,490
uh,

349
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,440
uh were there for a couple of year.

350
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,690
And while we're there,

351
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,900
was this got the chicken,

352
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:15,660
So I made a barn for it.

353
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,040
Looks like a bar was gonna need Ah,

354
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,330
it was a chicken house.

355
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,470
It had a place for the chicken,

356
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,350
the roost and all this.

357
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,990
So then when we moved to Manhattan to Kansas,

358
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,020
we had to take the chicken.

359
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,040
So when we got to the when Hatton,

360
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,020
then if you're in town and this 

361
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,720
guy would,

362
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:42,710
you know,

363
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,070
it's five o'clock in the morning.

364
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,890
It was loud throw in the hold.

365
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,980
So they had this tool shed,

366
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,310
and I did it.

367
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,790
I insulated so dark.

368
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:59,500
And then we build a place around a 

369
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,580
fence around there so that chicken would get out.

370
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,570
You know?

371
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:05,510
Well,

372
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,140
the chicken would hey,

373
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,340
would get out in the yard,

374
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:14,240
you chase the kids and,

375
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:14,590
uh,

376
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,400
they they would run,

377
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:16,730
you know?

378
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,160
Hey,

379
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,500
run out here all night,

380
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:22,475
so I thought,

381
00:14:22,475 --> 00:14:22,895
Hey,

382
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:23,285
you know,

383
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:27,875
look and all you have to do Let's keep the 

384
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,285
chicken from getting when he faces them,

385
00:14:30,285 --> 00:14:35,025
get their wings up like this and they would run.

386
00:14:35,135 --> 00:14:36,095
And so,

387
00:14:36,505 --> 00:14:36,865
look,

388
00:14:36,865 --> 00:14:39,735
it was just taken hold of wings in.

389
00:14:40,525 --> 00:14:41,365
You know?

390
00:14:41,365 --> 00:14:43,855
He won't I can't do anything.

391
00:14:44,335 --> 00:14:44,625
Yeah,

392
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:45,285
so I did.

393
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:47,215
I got that dude on.

394
00:14:47,225 --> 00:14:52,075
I have you like he was big and I had it in like this and he went on a 

395
00:14:52,085 --> 00:14:52,335
bit.

396
00:14:52,345 --> 00:14:55,745
Rommel it and it's still there today.

397
00:14:56,445 --> 00:14:59,225
Still a big star there today,

398
00:15:00,605 --> 00:15:01,105
Anyway,

399
00:15:01,105 --> 00:15:03,015
Then Robin got dogs.

400
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,105
And on the meantime,

401
00:15:06,135 --> 00:15:06,745
uh,

402
00:15:06,755 --> 00:15:08,765
this is fairly decent story.

403
00:15:08,765 --> 00:15:13,755
I guess the neighbors have the neighbors next to 

404
00:15:13,755 --> 00:15:14,095
us,

405
00:15:14,315 --> 00:15:19,045
and then they were on the corner and they had a swimming 

406
00:15:19,045 --> 00:15:22,485
pool there in the back that somebody had felt poorly,

407
00:15:22,485 --> 00:15:23,215
badly,

408
00:15:23,955 --> 00:15:26,435
where it was a big bills of lake swimming pool,

409
00:15:27,325 --> 00:15:27,885
and,

410
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:28,145
uh,

411
00:15:28,155 --> 00:15:30,165
but it was ground level.

412
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:36,685
So anyway,

413
00:15:36,695 --> 00:15:37,385
uh,

414
00:15:37,685 --> 00:15:42,455
they haven't had a flood in Manhattan in a around 1955.

415
00:15:42,455 --> 00:15:43,755
That a big flood.

416
00:15:43,755 --> 00:15:44,135
I mean,

417
00:15:44,135 --> 00:15:46,425
it flooded Ah,

418
00:15:46,715 --> 00:15:47,665
downtown,

419
00:15:48,235 --> 00:15:49,845
the whole downtown home.

420
00:15:49,945 --> 00:15:51,505
It's a very good sized town,

421
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:55,645
and it was at least that day defund in town.

422
00:15:55,995 --> 00:15:56,345
And,

423
00:15:56,345 --> 00:15:56,685
of course,

424
00:15:56,685 --> 00:16:01,125
the house We had had a basement and it flooded that mason 

425
00:16:02,015 --> 00:16:06,295
and there was mud mud still over the ceiling in the races.

426
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:09,725
And all that which we cleaned off,

427
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:12,045
made room stuff down there.

428
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,075
But anyway,

429
00:16:13,715 --> 00:16:18,315
it had raised the level of the yard so that the 

430
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:22,945
sidewalk was had one level and the ground was like that.

431
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:24,649
So we said,

432
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:24,949
Well,

433
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:27,279
we don't take care of that.

434
00:16:29,099 --> 00:16:31,529
My older son and I decided we would.

435
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:32,919
We were dating.

436
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:33,489
Dig it.

437
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:33,939
You know,

438
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:37,389
it was it was a shovel in the wheelbarrow and were taken.

439
00:16:37,989 --> 00:16:40,159
And there was a loaf place in the back.

440
00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:42,769
That's perfect place.

441
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:46,229
And just take the level of the yard.

442
00:16:46,229 --> 00:16:47,829
We'll put it in this low place,

443
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,299
which we did.

444
00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:54,559
And there's one nod from months and we're filing up the yard 

445
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:57,049
where it was down a free good side yard,

446
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:58,599
and,

447
00:16:58,599 --> 00:16:58,929
uh,

448
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:00,519
and we got it,

449
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:05,379
Got it down where it was level with the sidewalk and 

450
00:17:05,379 --> 00:17:06,579
then we replanted.

451
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:07,569
Turned out good.

452
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:08,489
Anyway,

453
00:17:08,489 --> 00:17:10,329
we have filled up this low flee.

454
00:17:13,219 --> 00:17:13,819
Well,

455
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,659
uh um,

456
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:16,689
before that,

457
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:17,479
it happened.

458
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:19,129
Ah,

459
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:25,839
while we were doing a little that it was came Christmas 

460
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,829
time and we went down there is on a to rid of my folks.

461
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:31,049
They were living down there,

462
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:35,699
and so we had gone and had to do something with the chicken.

463
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:36,579
Well,

464
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:38,479
the chicken with a problem because,

465
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:39,639
you know,

466
00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:40,829
they would crow,

467
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:41,309
right?

468
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:42,109
You know?

469
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:44,939
So anyway,

470
00:17:45,209 --> 00:17:45,829
somehow,

471
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:47,559
when they said they would neighbors,

472
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:49,229
they said to take care of the chicken.

473
00:17:50,219 --> 00:17:51,829
So when we got back,

474
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:54,009
uh,

475
00:17:54,529 --> 00:17:58,729
on the on the way back we got in a big snow storm and 

476
00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:02,729
and down in western Kansas,

477
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:07,259
and we should have never gotten into that.

478
00:18:08,219 --> 00:18:08,599
But,

479
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:09,099
uh,

480
00:18:10,719 --> 00:18:12,139
wait When?

481
00:18:12,139 --> 00:18:15,459
When Heads has got into it and I have Finally,

482
00:18:15,949 --> 00:18:18,059
the snow got deeper and deeper,

483
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:21,639
and I put chains on the car and,

484
00:18:21,639 --> 00:18:22,499
uh,

485
00:18:22,649 --> 00:18:25,834
and and the 

486
00:18:26,144 --> 00:18:29,634
way and the snow got deeper.

487
00:18:29,634 --> 00:18:30,774
Like I was saying,

488
00:18:31,914 --> 00:18:34,594
you just kept going who had changed?

489
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:36,134
Well,

490
00:18:36,134 --> 00:18:38,644
it finally came to a little town called somebody,

491
00:18:39,794 --> 00:18:44,244
and they had the snow would brawling across the other 

492
00:18:45,384 --> 00:18:48,624
on elevator on a sod and,

493
00:18:49,384 --> 00:18:50,114
uh,

494
00:18:50,124 --> 00:18:54,834
grain elevator and it had grown and the snow was 

495
00:18:54,844 --> 00:18:56,234
least tire.

496
00:18:56,234 --> 00:18:57,164
That feeling.

497
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:01,094
There was no way that was the end of that.

498
00:19:01,484 --> 00:19:01,824
Yeah.

499
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:06,134
So there we were at a big pile of snow,

500
00:19:07,384 --> 00:19:08,944
and there was a motel there.

501
00:19:08,944 --> 00:19:12,294
I go across this climb across the Snow Bank,

502
00:19:12,294 --> 00:19:14,734
and I was course in the meantime,

503
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:18,394
a lot of other trucks and stuff on the highway.

504
00:19:18,394 --> 00:19:20,024
They've been abandoned one.

505
00:19:20,754 --> 00:19:24,974
And so we wanted to this into this motel,

506
00:19:25,774 --> 00:19:26,374
and,

507
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:26,774
uh,

508
00:19:27,104 --> 00:19:28,354
it was full of people.

509
00:19:28,704 --> 00:19:30,234
There was a lot of people in there,

510
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:31,904
you know,

511
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:32,964
They brought him in.

512
00:19:36,284 --> 00:19:37,134
So anyway,

513
00:19:37,274 --> 00:19:37,504
uh,

514
00:19:37,514 --> 00:19:38,214
breaking a long,

515
00:19:38,214 --> 00:19:39,394
long story short.

516
00:19:40,234 --> 00:19:40,594
The,

517
00:19:40,604 --> 00:19:45,064
uh they were trying to replace these All these people in 

518
00:19:45,074 --> 00:19:46,744
homes in town.

519
00:19:47,884 --> 00:19:48,384
Well,

520
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:49,974
there was another.

521
00:19:49,984 --> 00:19:51,924
There was another couple with a couple.

522
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:52,694
There really was.

523
00:19:53,684 --> 00:19:57,274
There was 35 of us and another car.

524
00:19:57,274 --> 00:19:58,124
There was seven,

525
00:19:59,984 --> 00:20:00,364
uh,

526
00:20:00,374 --> 00:20:01,204
three children.

527
00:20:03,984 --> 00:20:04,574
And,

528
00:20:04,574 --> 00:20:04,994
uh,

529
00:20:06,424 --> 00:20:07,874
and so they said,

530
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:08,214
Well,

531
00:20:08,214 --> 00:20:12,894
we have a place over here that it was a 

532
00:20:13,424 --> 00:20:14,734
where they had dug down.

533
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:15,564
And actually,

534
00:20:15,564 --> 00:20:17,994
it was a blow ground house for 

535
00:20:20,294 --> 00:20:20,884
anyway,

536
00:20:20,884 --> 00:20:21,634
Loaded That.

537
00:20:21,704 --> 00:20:23,364
They said the sheriff will tell them.

538
00:20:23,364 --> 00:20:23,954
Get you.

539
00:20:26,174 --> 00:20:26,794
And,

540
00:20:26,794 --> 00:20:27,214
uh,

541
00:20:27,664 --> 00:20:29,024
So the sheriff game,

542
00:20:29,364 --> 00:20:29,914
he had a,

543
00:20:30,704 --> 00:20:31,314
uh,

544
00:20:31,494 --> 00:20:32,604
the sheriff's car.

545
00:20:32,604 --> 00:20:35,514
And then we got got all her stuff into this thing,

546
00:20:36,254 --> 00:20:37,584
including this couple.

547
00:20:38,284 --> 00:20:39,844
Have no idea how.

548
00:20:41,384 --> 00:20:41,674
Yeah,

549
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:42,294
there was.

550
00:20:42,344 --> 00:20:44,514
There was a sheriff in the density.

551
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:47,224
There were nine people in that car.

552
00:20:51,324 --> 00:20:51,984
Anyway,

553
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:54,774
we we go this this underground house,

554
00:20:54,774 --> 00:20:58,014
and this leg didn't have room for nine people.

555
00:20:59,204 --> 00:21:00,214
So you said,

556
00:21:00,514 --> 00:21:00,824
Well,

557
00:21:00,824 --> 00:21:02,024
I know another place.

558
00:21:02,024 --> 00:21:06,984
The sheriff said so we all climb back in the car and he 

559
00:21:07,044 --> 00:21:09,734
forget to this place she had to go through the yard.

560
00:21:09,744 --> 00:21:11,294
He had changed on this car.

561
00:21:12,974 --> 00:21:17,864
God driving through funerals yards in there because the snow was 

562
00:21:17,874 --> 00:21:22,664
so deep and we finally got to the places with and this 

563
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:23,214
lady,

564
00:21:23,254 --> 00:21:25,224
her name was Rosy Red,

565
00:21:26,884 --> 00:21:28,244
which had a big home.

566
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,274
We're great gold home there.

567
00:21:31,284 --> 00:21:32,514
And a huge,

568
00:21:33,804 --> 00:21:34,394
uh,

569
00:21:34,464 --> 00:21:38,984
freezer full of ice cream and steak 

570
00:21:40,354 --> 00:21:41,744
where there were a few days.

571
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:42,974
Well,

572
00:21:42,974 --> 00:21:43,404
anyway,

573
00:21:43,904 --> 00:21:46,654
after we find this snow finally melted,

574
00:21:46,804 --> 00:21:51,364
got it cleared up and we have a car started.

575
00:21:51,364 --> 00:21:52,184
I have no idea.

576
00:21:52,184 --> 00:21:57,134
How does the snow filled the entire and loan 

577
00:21:57,134 --> 00:21:57,864
in there?

578
00:21:57,874 --> 00:22:01,724
Fill the entire engine compartment was no.

579
00:22:02,044 --> 00:22:04,994
And I had to dig it out of the damn thing started.

580
00:22:05,104 --> 00:22:05,514
Yeah.

581
00:22:07,264 --> 00:22:07,824
Anyway,

582
00:22:07,824 --> 00:22:10,014
we finally got home and lo and behold,

583
00:22:10,014 --> 00:22:11,264
our chicken with dead.

584
00:22:13,024 --> 00:22:13,524
Yeah,

585
00:22:13,534 --> 00:22:14,074
right.

586
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:15,704
Yeah,

587
00:22:15,714 --> 00:22:16,224
right.

588
00:22:18,344 --> 00:22:19,964
I must have eaten him.

589
00:22:21,594 --> 00:22:23,324
Work Are your quick in one day.

590
00:22:23,914 --> 00:22:24,244
Well,

591
00:22:24,244 --> 00:22:24,884
anyway,

592
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:28,669
our relationship with them what kind of went down?

593
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:33,199
Because what happened then was a big rain.

594
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:38,749
And where we have filled in it was it was now higher than their 

595
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:43,829
swimming pool had a flint and the rain came and 

596
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:44,189
washed.

597
00:22:44,189 --> 00:22:46,369
All that's separating them ruined there.

598
00:22:46,379 --> 00:22:46,759
Who?

599
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:48,079
Oh,

600
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:48,449
yeah.

601
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:49,289
Oh,

602
00:22:49,289 --> 00:22:49,749
yeah,

603
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:50,219
yeah.

604
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:51,079
Absolutely.

605
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:51,659
Ruin them.

606
00:22:52,249 --> 00:22:53,529
So then they suited 

607
00:22:59,109 --> 00:22:59,839
Yeah,

608
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,569
they dropped the losses on it and I had homered.

609
00:23:03,579 --> 00:23:04,309
Insurance.

610
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:06,939
Renter's insurance,

611
00:23:06,939 --> 00:23:07,319
I guess.

612
00:23:07,329 --> 00:23:07,739
What?

613
00:23:08,329 --> 00:23:08,659
Uh,

614
00:23:09,499 --> 00:23:11,239
fall after whoever heard of that one.

615
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:12,679
Well,

616
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:13,049
anyway,

617
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:15,609
Robin got these dogs before age,

618
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:18,469
and we had this where there's chicken and vin.

619
00:23:18,829 --> 00:23:21,129
No damn dog could climb that fence.

620
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:21,799
It was,

621
00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:23,489
you know,

622
00:23:23,499 --> 00:23:23,809
I mean,

623
00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:27,259
never saw I never saw anything like it in all three of them.

624
00:23:27,649 --> 00:23:30,919
Like a brick in your climb that just like What?

625
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:32,079
Is she weak fencer?

626
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:34,299
Yeah.

627
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:35,159
Yeah,

628
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:37,519
it was no crane long.

629
00:23:39,149 --> 00:23:39,559
Yeah.

630
00:23:39,569 --> 00:23:42,429
And so I couldn't I couldn't do that.

631
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:44,879
So she finally got somebody in the country,

632
00:23:44,889 --> 00:23:49,869
agreed to take the three dogs that took care of her for a 

633
00:23:56,549 --> 00:23:56,869
and,

634
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:57,239
of course,

635
00:23:57,239 --> 00:23:59,109
Then the boys were into,

636
00:23:59,109 --> 00:23:59,429
ah,

637
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:04,189
Little League and all of that 

638
00:24:04,189 --> 00:24:04,729
stuff,

639
00:24:04,939 --> 00:24:06,769
and ah,

640
00:24:08,219 --> 00:24:10,689
it was for the good life there.

641
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,059
But,

642
00:24:12,489 --> 00:24:12,969
oh,

643
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:19,949
they were growing up trying to think What what else could say about 

644
00:24:19,949 --> 00:24:20,359
that?

645
00:24:21,549 --> 00:24:21,959
Ah,

646
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:24,179
Robin.

647
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:26,059
She was a teenager.

648
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:27,039
She was well,

649
00:24:27,836 --> 00:24:29,736
probably about one that time.

650
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:34,736
Feels a junior or maybe a senior junior,

651
00:24:34,736 --> 00:24:35,266
I think.

652
00:24:37,256 --> 00:24:40,296
But she had a boyfriend who was black.

653
00:24:42,556 --> 00:24:43,086
Well,

654
00:24:43,286 --> 00:24:47,616
that you know that my wife didn't think too much of that.

655
00:24:49,556 --> 00:24:50,586
He was nice enough,

656
00:24:50,596 --> 00:24:51,346
I guess.

657
00:24:52,456 --> 00:24:52,816
And,

658
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:53,276
uh,

659
00:24:53,546 --> 00:24:54,166
anyway,

660
00:24:54,636 --> 00:24:56,026
that went on for a while,

661
00:24:56,026 --> 00:24:56,266
Then.

662
00:24:57,056 --> 00:24:59,296
Then I got a job at Texas A and M.

663
00:24:59,306 --> 00:25:04,186
So we moved down here and through all that in the 

664
00:25:04,186 --> 00:25:04,836
meantime,

665
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,416
of course,

666
00:25:05,426 --> 00:25:06,906
Uh uh,

667
00:25:06,996 --> 00:25:11,546
The those Kyle was born in that 

668
00:25:11,556 --> 00:25:12,566
process,

669
00:25:13,256 --> 00:25:16,796
and they're So when we were in Manhattan,

670
00:25:16,796 --> 00:25:17,946
they were four children,

671
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:23,676
and he was little yet ready two or three or floor.

672
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:27,776
And so we were only will down here.

673
00:25:29,456 --> 00:25:30,116
Well,

674
00:25:30,256 --> 00:25:33,486
as the year went by when moved down here and,

675
00:25:33,496 --> 00:25:33,866
uh,

676
00:25:35,706 --> 00:25:39,266
I I came down and they stayed up there because they,

677
00:25:39,756 --> 00:25:40,336
uh,

678
00:25:41,086 --> 00:25:44,026
Lane was in college and Robin with a senior,

679
00:25:44,026 --> 00:25:45,696
I think at that point 

680
00:25:51,756 --> 00:25:55,156
So we had formed the covert corporation.

681
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:56,926
Uh,

682
00:25:57,146 --> 00:26:01,426
to do educational evaluation was called every 

683
00:26:02,056 --> 00:26:04,366
educational development resource 

684
00:26:07,356 --> 00:26:07,926
and,

685
00:26:07,936 --> 00:26:08,276
uh,

686
00:26:08,286 --> 00:26:11,476
way we're contracting the whole lot of 

687
00:26:12,956 --> 00:26:17,316

688
00:26:17,316 --> 00:26:18,086
education.

689
00:26:18,856 --> 00:26:20,476
And they were going up the aisle.

690
00:26:20,476 --> 00:26:20,966
Uh,

691
00:26:21,656 --> 00:26:22,106
and,

692
00:26:22,116 --> 00:26:22,466
uh,

693
00:26:23,426 --> 00:26:24,036
was there,

694
00:26:24,036 --> 00:26:24,366
uh,

695
00:26:25,256 --> 00:26:28,596
Onda Rasca putting on all this?

696
00:26:30,162 --> 00:26:30,762

698
00:26:33,822 --> 00:26:37,522
where we could file gramps and on all that.

699
00:26:37,532 --> 00:26:41,562
So we formed this corporation on probably Yeah,

700
00:26:41,572 --> 00:26:42,512
we're going.

701
00:26:42,522 --> 00:26:42,942
Well,

702
00:26:42,942 --> 00:26:43,242
well,

703
00:26:43,762 --> 00:26:45,672
we wanted a trailer out.

704
00:26:46,682 --> 00:26:47,002
Um,

705
00:26:47,762 --> 00:26:48,392
trailer,

706
00:26:48,392 --> 00:26:48,952
It was funny,

707
00:26:48,952 --> 00:26:49,262
but,

708
00:26:49,422 --> 00:26:49,872
you know,

709
00:26:50,362 --> 00:26:51,682
So when I came down here,

710
00:26:51,682 --> 00:26:53,782
I just moved down here with it.

711
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,422

so they all stayed up there for a while on Robert gradually,

714
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,172
I think.

715
00:27:07,912 --> 00:27:08,432
You know,

716
00:27:08,532 --> 00:27:11,252

00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:17,830
in this case,

1342
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,410
you have new maintenance stuff.

1343
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:20,080

1344
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:25,460

so they get some of that,

1350
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,060
but I think they're doing rolling.

1351
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:35,430
Well,

1352
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:35,730

1355
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:44,330
and he's been with him for years.

1356
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:47,270
I don't know any work for them,

1357
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:49,760
but then he has college everywhere.

1358
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:50,690
Okay.

1362
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:00,560

1372
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,170
