6
00:00:08,62 --> 00:00:08,85

7
00:00:09,6 --> 00:00:10,75
We're talking

8
00:00:09,59 --> 00:00:10,75
We're talking

9
00:00:11,9 --> 00:00:12,35
Don't worry

10
00:00:15,08 --> 00:00:17,45
We have got to um We had gotten to um

11
00:00:18,0 --> 00:00:19,83
you got to the point where we're starting to talk

12
00:00:19,83 --> 00:00:19,45
about we had gotten to the point where we're starting

13
00:00:19,45 --> 00:00:22,88
to talk about um about your children

14
00:00:22,89 --> 00:00:25,25
He talked a little bit about where you grew up

15
00:00:21,74 --> 00:00:22,76
about your children

16
00:00:22,8 --> 00:00:25,25
You talked a little bit about where you grew up

17
00:00:00,undefined --> 00:00:25,25


18
00:00:26,85 --> 00:00:28,99
and then the point in your life where you were

19
00:00:28,99 --> 00:00:30,37
starting to have children

20
00:00:30,64 --> 00:00:28,17
Many you mentioned that you had And then the point

21
00:00:28,17 --> 00:00:30,34
in your life where you were starting to have children

22
00:00:00,undefined --> 00:00:30,34


23
00:00:30,81 --> 00:00:32,16
You mentioned that you had

24
00:00:32,94 --> 00:00:33,15
No

25
00:00:35,72 --> 00:00:37,8
He had three of them at the time and then

26
00:00:37,9 --> 00:00:39,74
another one came a little bit later

27
00:00:39,74 --> 00:00:41,54
So that's where you want

28
00:00:35,69 --> 00:00:37,45
If you had three of them at the time and

29
00:00:37,45 --> 00:00:39,71
then another one came a little bit later

30
00:00:39,71 --> 00:00:40,53
So no if you want

31
00:00:40,54 --> 00:00:41,55
If that's where you want

32
00:00:42,8 --> 00:00:43,1
Yeah

33
00:00:43,1 --> 00:00:46,24
I think that's a good place to start I think

34
00:00:00,undefined --> 00:00:46,24


35
00:00:42,72 --> 00:00:43,89

44
00:01:09,24 --> 00:01:12,19
It was really really cold at winner

45
00:01:12,2 --> 00:01:13,69

47
00:00:00,undefined --> 00:01:12,15

And then the second year we But we did all

54
00:01:26,2 --> 00:01:26,58
right

55
00:01:26,59 --> 00:01:30,3
And then the second year we I think it was

56
00:01:30,35 --> 00:01:30,81
a cord

57
00:01:30,81 --> 00:01:32,12
The end of the second year

58
00:01:32,12 --> 00:01:36,67
We way build a house and moved in out of

59
00:01:36,67 --> 00:01:37,36
the trailer

60
00:01:37,96 --> 00:01:40,15
I have no idea what happened to the trailer

61
00:01:29,04 --> 00:01:31,83
I think it was toward the end of the second

62
00:01:31,84 --> 00:01:37,31
year way build a house and moved in our trailer

63
00:00:00,undefined --> 00:01:37,31


64
00:01:37,7 --> 00:01:40,05
I have no idea what happened to the trail

65
00:01:40,77 --> 00:01:43,33
Let any way way But anyway we uh we will

66
00:01:43,33 --> 00:01:46,44
did to this house and that was it was kind

67
00:01:46,44 --> 00:01:46,86
of needed

68
00:01:46,86 --> 00:01:43,7
It was a one bedroom to bedroom we moved into

69
00:01:43,7 --> 00:01:44,48
this house

70
00:01:46,82 --> 00:01:51,76
It was a one bedroom too upstairs in a full

71
00:01:51,76 --> 00:01:55,84
mason which was made into an apartment which we uh

72
00:01:55,94 --> 00:01:56,71
we read it

73
00:01:56,72 --> 00:01:57,3
Finally

74
00:01:50,24 --> 00:01:54,46
upstairs in a full basement which was made into apartment

75
00:01:54,47 --> 00:01:55,15
with three

76
00:01:56,01 --> 00:02:01,13
We read it But it was it was a pretty

77
00:02:01,34 --> 00:02:02,01
pretty neat

78
00:01:58,44 --> 00:02:01,76
but it was it was for the party

79
00:02:02,82 --> 00:02:03,38
The only problem with with it wasthe that The only

80
00:02:03,45 --> 00:02:08,55
problem was with it Waas that the uh the uh

81
00:02:09,38 --> 00:02:13,85
basement basement and the sewer system that when build in

82
00:02:13,85 --> 00:02:11,43
Gunnison was probably round the turn of the century and

83
00:02:11,65 --> 00:02:16,31
the sewer system when building guns was probably around the

84
00:02:16,32 --> 00:02:17,5
turn of the century

85
00:02:17,71 --> 00:02:18,15
Okay

86
00:02:18,5 --> 00:02:21,18
and it was what they call open sewer

87
00:02:18,54 --> 00:02:20,51
And it was what they call open

88
00:02:21,52 --> 00:02:25,91
Okay And so so and the water table get above

89
00:02:25,91 --> 00:02:25,22
the sewer their sewer it don't work the water table

90
00:02:25,22 --> 00:02:28,02
get above the store this tour and don't work

91
00:02:28,34 --> 00:02:28,84
Okay

92
00:02:28,47 --> 00:02:28,82
Okay

93
00:02:30,27 --> 00:02:33,55
And so that's what happened in the spring because the

94
00:02:33,55 --> 00:02:35,69
snow would melt a lot of that

95
00:02:35,7 --> 00:02:34,42
Then So what happened Frank Because snow would melt

96
00:02:34,43 --> 00:02:35,64
Yeah allow that

97
00:02:36,62 --> 00:02:39,38
at that point you got you got a real problem

98
00:02:39,38 --> 00:02:42,89
in the basement trying to get it to flush and

99
00:02:42,89 --> 00:02:39,71
all that At that point you got a real problem

100
00:00:00,undefined --> 00:02:39,71


101
00:02:44,27 --> 00:02:48,11
but uh What and it was a problem a lot

102
00:00:00,undefined --> 00:02:48,11


103
00:02:48,12 --> 00:02:46,22
And there was nothing they could do about it And

104
00:02:46,39 --> 00:02:48,0
it was a a lot

105
00:02:48,23 --> 00:02:49,85
They're nothing like d'oh

106
00:02:50,92 --> 00:02:52,11
except to replace the whole sewer system Except replace the

107
00:02:52,11 --> 00:02:57,96
whole sources right Sure they probably have you done yet

108
00:02:55,13 --> 00:02:57,94
which they probably haven't done yet

109
00:02:58,37 --> 00:03:02,06
I wouldn't I wouldn't think uh would

110
00:03:02,06 --> 00:03:02,24
Anyway we uh it turned out really well and date

111
00:03:02,24 --> 00:03:05,21
away We uh turned out rather well

112
00:03:06,43 --> 00:03:08,93
I uh I brought a Oh yeah I brought the

113
00:03:10,56 --> 00:03:14,43
a wielding welding that had been used for menus or

114
00:03:15,01 --> 00:03:23,48
trucks where it was trucks where Ah no gas trucks

115
00:00:00,undefined --> 00:03:23,48


116
00:03:22,09 --> 00:03:30,77
gas Actually like actually like uh you they call it

117
00:03:31,1 --> 00:03:32,14
Elfi Gas

118
00:03:32,14 --> 00:03:32,78
There we go

119
00:03:27,52 --> 00:03:29,23
Oh you right

120
00:03:30,12 --> 00:03:31,73
We call it fake

121
00:03:32,22 --> 00:03:32,67
Here we go

122
00:03:33,2 --> 00:03:34,59
Elfi Gas trucks

123
00:03:34,64 --> 00:03:35,71
You this L ve gas strokes and used this thing

124
00:00:00,undefined --> 00:03:35,71


125
00:03:35,71 --> 00:03:38,87
And so they wanted to sell the building and I

126
00:03:38,87 --> 00:03:38,07
bought that thing and then So they want to sell

127
00:03:38,07 --> 00:03:38,6
a building

128
00:03:38,6 --> 00:03:42,49
And I bought that thing Moved it down there on

129
00:03:42,5 --> 00:03:42,97
the back

130
00:03:41,17 --> 00:03:43,57
moved it down there on the back of our place

131
00:00:00,undefined --> 00:03:43,57


132
00:03:43,58 --> 00:03:46,45
So it was It was a big big building

133
00:03:46,45 --> 00:03:52,11
And eventually I made it into a shopping then into

134
00:03:52,11 --> 00:03:52,96
a business

135
00:03:52,96 --> 00:03:56,74
And we had all the repair business back there

136
00:03:44,7 --> 00:03:46,27
It was a late late will

137
00:03:47,64 --> 00:03:53,91
Eventually I waded into job into a business way

138
00:03:53,91 --> 00:03:56,17
Had all of repair business

139
00:03:57,63 --> 00:04:01,5
But anyway But anyway uh there was a kind of

140
00:04:01,5 --> 00:04:04,62
an adventure with that because I went up

141
00:04:04,62 --> 00:04:07,56
Thio didn't measure the building

142
00:04:07,57 --> 00:04:09,8
They told me what the two inches were

143
00:04:00,7 --> 00:04:04,02
there was kind of the venture with that because I

144
00:04:04,03 --> 00:04:07,52
went up to did major building

145
00:04:07,58 --> 00:04:08,42
They told me with

146
00:04:11,62 --> 00:04:17,66
So then I made a foundation poured concrete did that

147
00:00:00,undefined --> 00:04:17,66


148
00:04:17,72 --> 00:04:17,155
So So then I made a foundation and poured concrete

149
00:00:00,undefined --> 00:04:17,155


150
00:04:17,155 --> 00:04:21,83
Did that went So yeah the And uh we're doing

151
00:04:21,83 --> 00:04:21,825
infections that I would call Ah I would do it

152
00:00:00,undefined --> 00:04:21,825


153
00:04:21,825 --> 00:04:26,645
Infections and I would call ready mix and they would

154
00:04:26,645 --> 00:04:27,155
cover

155
00:04:27,295 --> 00:04:29,525
And I'd screed it and do it

156
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:31,535
And then I'd make another section

157
00:04:31,545 --> 00:04:26,27
So then already makes them

158
00:04:26,27 --> 00:04:29,5
They would cover excreted do it

159
00:04:29,7 --> 00:04:33,835
Then I make another faction will Then then I moved

160
00:04:33,835 --> 00:04:34,185
about

161
00:04:34,185 --> 00:04:36,885
They moved the building and well the building was bigger

162
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:34,206
than Then I moved about

163
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:37,126
They moved The building and loan building were bigger than

164
00:04:38,376 --> 00:04:43,576
a foundation was hanging over about about 18

165
00:04:39,065 --> 00:04:43,935
yeah So it was hanging over Well about 18 inches

166
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:47,045
or so which was really a problem

167
00:04:47,055 --> 00:04:47,006
Yeah We should really bro

168
00:04:47,016 --> 00:04:52,855
Yeah but eventually was able to pour more concrete in

169
00:04:52,855 --> 00:04:53,165
there

170
00:04:53,175 --> 00:04:54,115
Take care of that

171
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,435
But it turned out okay

172
00:04:48,236 --> 00:04:53,186
but electorally was able to pour more concrete in there

173
00:00:00,undefined --> 00:04:53,186


174
00:04:53,236 --> 00:04:54,126
Take care of that

175
00:04:54,136 --> 00:04:55,446
But it turned out okay

176
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:57,985
And the building was a good one

177
00:04:56,036 --> 00:04:57,926
And the belly was a good one

178
00:04:58,745 --> 00:05:02,545
And we made a shop that had big door because

All those three grew up nicely

281
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:12,116
Although three grew up nicely

282
00:08:13,488 --> 00:08:16,983
And uh and so And uh So the question is

283
00:08:16,983 --> 00:08:19,433
what happened to the word they go on Well that

284
00:08:19,443 --> 00:08:20,563
we grow up

285
00:08:16,116 --> 00:08:18,996
the question is what happened to you Wherever you go

286
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:23,433
throw And of course in the meantime we have

287
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:24,633

still over the ceiling in the races

534
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:11,525
And all that which we cleaned off made room stuff

535
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:12,045
down there

536
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:00,76

But anyway it had raised the level of the yard

540
00:16:13,68 --> 00:16:18,105
it had raised the level of the yard so that

541
00:16:18,105 --> 00:16:22,235
the sidewalk was had one level and the ground was

542
00:16:22,245 --> 00:16:22,945
like that

543
00:16:17,58 --> 00:16:25,38
so that the sidewalk was at one level ground way

544
00:00:00,undefined --> 00:16:25,38

That's perfect place

561
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:46,229
And just take the level of the yard
