1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,880
we'll start recording here.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,440
All right,

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,850
So now I have to remember where we left off last week.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,750
We're talking.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,350
Don't worry.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,340
We had gotten to,

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,230
um we had gotten to the point where we're starting to talk about,

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:20,740
um,

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,880
about your children.

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,250
He talked a little bit about where you grew up,

11
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,370
and then the point in your life where you were starting to have children.

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,180
Many you mentioned that you had?

13
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,150
No.

14
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,290
If you had three of them at the time,

15
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,710
and then another one came a little bit later.

16
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,160
So no,

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:40,530
if you want.

18
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,550
If that's where you want.

19
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,890
Pick back up.

20
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,750
Just Are you okay?

21
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:47,740
So,

22
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:53,720
no.

23
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,000
In the fall

24
00:00:59,250 --> 00:00:59,640
on,

25
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:04,610
then my older a boy was born in number.

26
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:05,150
Okay?

27
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:10,170
And then we have to make it through the winter with

28
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:10,890
really,

29
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,150
really cold winter.

30
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,680
He did all right.

31
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,530
I have my dad like,

32
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,280
Grandad were so excited because the other boy

33
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,580
so But we did all right.

34
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,780
And then the second year,

35
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,110
we I think it was toward the end of the second year

36
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,640
way build a house and moved in our

37
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:37,310
trailer.

38
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,050
I have no idea what happened to the trail.

39
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,480
Let any way way we moved into this house.

40
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,330
It was a one bedroom,

41
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,440
too upstairs in a full basement,

42
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,150
which was made into apartment with three.

43
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:56,690
We read it,

44
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,760
but it was it was for the party.

45
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,250
The only problem was with it Waas that

46
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,240
the,

47
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:08,550
uh,

48
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:14,300
basement and the sewer system when building guns

49
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,500
was probably around the turn of the century.

50
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,150
Okay.

51
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,510
And it was what they call open.

52
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:21,850
Okay,

53
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,600
so the water table get above the store,

54
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,020
this tour and don't work.

55
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:28,840
Okay.

56
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,280
So what happened,

57
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:32,930
Frank?

58
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,420
Because snow would melt.

59
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:34,870
Yeah,

60
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,640
allow that.

61
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,500
At that point,

62
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,710
you got a real problem.

63
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:44,680
What?

64
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,000
And it was a a lot.

65
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,850
They're nothing like d'oh.

66
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,330
Except replace the whole sources,

67
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:53,830
right?

68
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:55,780
Sure,

69
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,960
they probably have you done yet

70
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,670
date away?

71
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,090
We,

72
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,330
uh,

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,210
turned out rather well.

74
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,770
Oh,

75
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,180
yeah,

76
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,360
I brought the welding

77
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,260
menus or trucks where

78
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,930
no gas

79
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,820
actually like Oh,

80
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,230
you right.

81
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,730
We call it fake.

82
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:32,670
Here we go.

83
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,590
Elfi Gas trucks.

84
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,390
You this?

85
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,600
So they want to sell a building.

86
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,810
And I bought that thing,

87
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,970
Moved it down there on the back.

88
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,270
It was a late late will.

89
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,430
Eventually,

90
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:53,000
I waded into job into a business

91
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:53,910
way.

92
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,170
Had all of repair business.

93
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,640
But anyway,

94
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,130
there was kind of the venture with that because I went up to

95
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,520
did major building.

96
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,420
They told me with.

97
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,260
So then I made a foundation,

98
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,060
poured concrete,

99
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:17,660
did that.

100
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,350
So yeah,

101
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,750
the we're doing infections that I would call

102
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,270
already makes them.

103
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,500
They would cover excreted do it.

104
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,280
Then I make another faction will Then?

105
00:04:32,836 --> 00:04:34,206
Then I moved about.

106
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:38,756
They moved The building and loan building were bigger than a

107
00:04:38,756 --> 00:04:43,576
foundation was hanging over about about 18.

108
00:04:45,776 --> 00:04:46,506
We should really,

109
00:04:46,516 --> 00:04:47,006
bro.

110
00:04:47,016 --> 00:04:47,646
Yeah,

111
00:04:48,236 --> 00:04:53,186
but electorally was able to pour more concrete in there.

112
00:04:53,236 --> 00:04:54,126
Take care of that.

113
00:04:54,136 --> 00:04:55,446
But it turned out okay.

114
00:04:56,036 --> 00:04:57,926
And the belly was a good one.

115
00:04:58,816 --> 00:05:02,096
And we made itself had big door.

116
00:05:02,526 --> 00:05:03,726
You tow trucks.

117
00:05:04,736 --> 00:05:07,176
And so it worked out good.

118
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:07,406
Well,

119
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:07,966
anyway,

120
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:09,846
my oldest of that.

121
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:11,966
And then two years later,

122
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:16,856
while Robin Tain and then two

123
00:05:16,856 --> 00:05:18,396
years after that flip.

124
00:05:19,396 --> 00:05:21,966
So they're all the same.

125
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:22,896
Oh,

126
00:05:24,136 --> 00:05:24,616
well,

127
00:05:26,036 --> 00:05:26,446
huh?

128
00:05:29,126 --> 00:05:29,366
Why?

129
00:05:29,366 --> 00:05:34,286
They blade down

130
00:05:34,286 --> 00:05:34,896
those up.

131
00:05:34,906 --> 00:05:36,276
Where is going to school?

132
00:05:38,176 --> 00:05:39,166
Start school,

133
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:43,246
I guess with kindergarten and mother was

134
00:05:46,636 --> 00:05:48,366
right about six blocks away.

135
00:05:48,446 --> 00:05:48,736
Okay,

136
00:05:52,196 --> 00:05:52,746
I love that.

137
00:05:53,626 --> 00:05:54,606
But hey,

138
00:05:54,606 --> 00:05:56,446
would walk to school.

139
00:05:56,446 --> 00:05:57,306
Even the weather.

140
00:05:59,116 --> 00:05:59,876
I mean,

141
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:01,416
That's why they did it.

142
00:06:02,736 --> 00:06:04,106
So he started school,

143
00:06:05,436 --> 00:06:07,246
and in the meantime,

144
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:10,126
I got it,

145
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:10,646
too.

146
00:06:11,136 --> 00:06:12,766
I was in the chamber of cowards.

147
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:13,446
Witness.

148
00:06:13,516 --> 00:06:14,646
Then I gotta do it.

149
00:06:15,836 --> 00:06:16,846
We have,

150
00:06:18,236 --> 00:06:22,976
apart from a client moving story and all

151
00:06:22,976 --> 00:06:23,326
that.

152
00:06:24,736 --> 00:06:25,146
Yeah,

153
00:06:25,246 --> 00:06:25,646
uh,

154
00:06:26,236 --> 00:06:27,956
sold examiners

155
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:35,356
really good witness because they have always

156
00:06:36,976 --> 00:06:41,956
dude ranches in hotels and stuff that we're coming in on.

157
00:06:42,086 --> 00:06:42,526
Uh,

158
00:06:42,786 --> 00:06:44,546
it was a great place to sell.

159
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:48,226
No,

160
00:06:48,236 --> 00:06:51,056
we're putting the whole of withdrawing pretty well.

161
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:52,276
Got cash poor,

162
00:06:55,466 --> 00:07:00,086
not support your And so I

163
00:07:00,096 --> 00:07:02,776
sold the business my part of the business.

164
00:07:02,776 --> 00:07:04,646
And then I went back to college together.

165
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:05,676
Master degree.

166
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:10,616
I heard that if we were paid for you,

167
00:07:10,846 --> 00:07:11,436
you know,

168
00:07:11,446 --> 00:07:12,776
you have the whole summer off.

169
00:07:12,856 --> 00:07:13,826
Yeah,

170
00:07:15,856 --> 00:07:17,536
that sounds like a really good deal,

171
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:18,066
you know?

172
00:07:18,766 --> 00:07:19,276
Yeah.

173
00:07:19,716 --> 00:07:21,406
I fled with some were fishing,

174
00:07:24,316 --> 00:07:24,936
right?

175
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:31,216
That that was and

176
00:07:31,216 --> 00:07:33,826
eventually I worked with four.

177
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:35,076
Federer's for a while,

178
00:07:35,156 --> 00:07:38,896
But then then I graduated,

179
00:07:38,896 --> 00:07:40,336
and I needed a job,

180
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:45,076
So I got a job.

181
00:07:45,086 --> 00:07:50,006
Carl said the ration co So any way moved to Carl?

182
00:07:50,016 --> 00:07:50,236
Well,

183
00:07:50,246 --> 00:07:52,226
well Oh,

184
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,766
So they're one year,

185
00:07:57,926 --> 00:07:58,526
Roger.

186
00:07:58,526 --> 00:07:59,016
All right,

187
00:07:59,026 --> 00:08:00,726
go for earlier.

188
00:08:02,056 --> 00:08:06,846
It's a New Mexico military looks like the long story

189
00:08:06,846 --> 00:08:08,876
Short like a lie.

190
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:12,116
Although three grew up nicely.

191
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:14,066
And,

192
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:14,426
uh,

193
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:16,966
So the question is,

194
00:08:16,986 --> 00:08:17,946
what happened to you?

195
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:22,926
Wherever you go throw and the court from the time

00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:24,470
built a There was a tool shed black clear in the

282
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,190
back with a big old house that had been build around

283
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,420
18 mighty.

284
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,430
I guess it was maybe a little later,

285
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,590
but it had a no carriage house.

286
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,350
Coup story,

287
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,040
Eric World.

00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,840
It had two doors.

289
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,080
Had one in front one of the back and run your carriage in there.

290
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:56,060
And then there was a place where he could take the horse home aside.

291
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:56,960
You know,

292
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,470
they did cool.

293
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,110
My folks have been really nice.

294
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:12,540
They thought because my dad win the hatchery with

295
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,330
one time.

296
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,170
He thought when you

297
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,040

298
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,860

300
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,170
The thing about so big remember much about it.

301
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,220
with your eggs in there,

302
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,390
and then it would hold temperature shared out,

303
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,320
whatever happens.

304
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:38,209
Yeah.

305
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:40,759
And it was a rooster.

306
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:41,839
Yeah.

307
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:44,009
So,

308
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:44,579
anyway,

309
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:46,839
that was in labor and Arizona.

310
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:48,429
We've time.

311
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:56,109
I took a job in Mexico,

312
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,839
and then then I went back to graduate school.

313
00:13:01,099 --> 00:13:01,409
Uh,

314
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,349
you were there for a couple of years.

315
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:09,809
And while we're there was a chicken,

316
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:15,669
so I made a bargain for it.

317
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,439
Looks like a war was coming,

318
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:17,809
mate.

319
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:20,309
Tricking house.

320
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:22,479
You have a place for the chicken,

321
00:13:22,489 --> 00:13:24,329
the rooms to all this.

322
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,909
So that when we moved the Manhattan Kansas,

323
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:31,909
we had to take two chicken,

324
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:38,109
so they got to the man had your town,

325
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:42,639
and this guy would Yeah,

more loud.

327
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,109
Yeah.

328
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,939
So I had this pool fed.

329
00:13:50,619 --> 00:13:53,709
I insulated four door.

330
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:54,929

332
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:00,609
around there.

333
00:14:01,979 --> 00:14:03,779
Chicken would get out,

334
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:04,289
you know?

335
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:05,509
Well,

336
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:10,009

338
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:14,179
And,

339
00:14:14,189 --> 00:14:14,529
uh,

340
00:14:15,099 --> 00:14:16,189
they would run.

341
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,179
Hey,

342
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,509

343
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:21,349
No.

344
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:22,469
So I said,

345
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:22,919
hey,

346
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:23,319

all you have to do people picked him from

349
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,969
when he traced them to win the and

350
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:34,889

353
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,030
Right?

354
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,540
So I got you like they

355
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,340
were big like this,

356
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,990
and he went out with one lip.

357
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:55,880
Yeah.

358
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,100
Anyway,

359
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,970
then Robin got dogs.

360
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,590
Okay,

361
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,090
along In the meantime,

362
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,880
this is a fairly decent story.

363
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,690
The neighbors,

364
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,990
the neighbors next to us.

365
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,190
And then they were on the corner,

366
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,580
and they had a slumming pool back.

367
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,890
Nobody will.

368
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:22,440
Yeah,

369
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,180
okay.

370
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:29,120
It was a big building And what it was

371
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,040
ground low.

372
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:36,650
So anyway,

373
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:42,460
they had a flood tonight around 1955.

374
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,690
That a great flood.

375
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,150
I mean,

376
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,640
it flooded downtown,

377
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,410
the whole downtown.

378
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:49,840
Oh,

379
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,090
good side of town It was.

380
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,490
At least I did deep on in town.

381
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:56,340
And,

382
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:56,700
of course,

383
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:00,760
the house we had had a bracelet flooded that.

384
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:01,870
Yeah,

385
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:06,320
there was Bud much still on the ceiling of the racial,

386
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:11,530
which we cleaned off room stuff.

387
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,090
But anyway,

388
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,300
it had raised the level of the yard so that the

389
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,550
sidewalk was at one level,

390
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:25,380

00:24:19,368 --> 00:24:20,278
Sorry about that,

587
00:24:23,478 --> 00:24:23,998

588
00:24:24,768 --> 00:24:25,988
She was a teenager.

590
00:24:26,668 --> 00:24:27,018

Feels junior okay.

593
00:24:31,868 --> 00:24:32,308
Or maybe

594
00:24:37,318 --> 00:24:40,168
But she had a boyfriend who was black.

595
00:24:42,568 --> 00:24:43,098
Well,

00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:44,778

I got a job in Texas.

601
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:00,818
So we moved down here?

602
00:25:03,158 --> 00:25:03,578
Yeah,

603
00:25:03,968 --> 00:25:04,448

606
00:25:06,568 --> 00:25:06,858
Uh,

607
00:25:08,868 --> 00:25:10,008

608
00:25:15,168 --> 00:25:16,778
so we were happy.

609
00:25:16,788 --> 00:25:17,478
They were four.

610
00:25:18,028 --> 00:25:18,378
Okay.

611
00:25:19,568 --> 00:25:20,908

No.

616
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,638
As the years went by,

617
00:25:31,878 --> 00:25:33,138
we moved down here.

618
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:36,528

00:47:51,783 --> 00:47:56,493

00:48:15,853 --> 00:48:16,683
Rentals.

1237
00:48:19,033 --> 00:48:19,213
Oh,

1238
00:48:19,213 --> 00:48:20,083

00:48:20,713 --> 00:48:22,283
School system better?

1240
00:48:22,643 --> 00:48:23,163
Okay.

1241
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:23,893
Yeah.

1242
00:48:24,253 --> 00:48:28,407
So now they somebody house sale,

1243
00:48:31,997 --> 00:48:33,377
for one thing.

1244
00:48:33,497 --> 00:48:33,907
Yeah.

1245
00:48:34,917 --> 00:48:35,537
That's smart,

1246
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:35,737
though.

1247
00:48:36,357 --> 00:48:38,127
Supposed to be the good investment.

1248
00:48:38,527 --> 00:48:39,617
Smart investments.

1249
00:48:41,817 --> 00:48:42,227
Yeah.

1250
00:48:43,217 --> 00:48:43,517
Yeah,

1251
00:48:43,647 --> 00:48:44,457
I tried that.

1252
00:48:45,067 --> 00:48:45,427
Did you?

1253
00:48:46,917 --> 00:48:47,287
Yeah.

00:48:49,897 --> 00:48:50,407
Good band.

00:48:50,407 --> 00:48:50,877

I know how that goes.

1259
00:48:59,627 --> 00:49:01,827
You gotta go break.

1260
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:08,677
Suppose the RV parks are the way to go because all you have to do is rent out the space.

1261
00:49:08,687 --> 00:49:10,547
They have to provide everything else.

1262
00:49:11,177 --> 00:49:11,517
And,

1263
00:49:11,517 --> 00:49:11,827
uh,

1264
00:49:12,217 --> 00:49:13,287
guess it's a lot easier.

1265
00:49:14,517 --> 00:49:14,727
No.

1266
00:49:16,497 --> 00:49:17,017
Well,

1267
00:49:17,077 --> 00:49:17,847
in this case,

1268
00:49:19,547 --> 00:49:20,137
yeah,

1269
00:49:20,777 --> 00:49:25,197
that's gonna be a lot like you.

1270
00:49:25,597 --> 00:49:26,767
Yeah,

1271
00:49:27,607 --> 00:49:29,227
that's great.

1272
00:49:29,617 --> 00:49:30,527
Yeah.

1273
00:49:31,417 --> 00:49:31,787
Yeah,

1274
00:49:32,187 --> 00:49:33,687
they get some of that.

1275
00:49:33,807 --> 00:49:35,087
You think they're going wrong?

1276
00:49:35,087 --> 00:49:35,487
Well,

1277
00:49:39,557 --> 00:49:39,937
okay.

1278
00:49:40,797 --> 00:49:42,337
He works for an oil company.

1279
00:49:42,997 --> 00:49:44,327
Let us for years.

1280
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:47,227
I don't know what he worked for him.

1281
00:49:47,457 --> 00:49:47,857
Yeah,

1282
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,737
he has cows everywhere.

1283
00:49:50,217 --> 00:49:51,357
Okay,

1284
00:49:52,387 --> 00:49:56,897
Granddad was it was a president of the

1285
00:49:56,907 --> 00:49:58,817
bank during the

1286
00:50:02,427 --> 00:50:03,137
Yeah,

1287
00:50:03,377 --> 00:50:03,837

1288
00:50:05,357 --> 00:50:05,767
Yeah.

So they have have your house,

1290
00:50:13,617 --> 00:50:16,597
So I think he's doing okay?

1291
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:24,827
I don't think I don't think they have the oil wells tell he's

1292
00:50:24,837 --> 00:50:25,767
Asian oil.

1293
00:50:26,177 --> 00:50:26,577
Yeah,

1294
00:50:28,864 --> 00:50:30,674
s so it sounds like everyone's doing good.

1295
00:50:30,774 --> 00:50:31,274
Oh,

1296
00:50:31,464 --> 00:50:31,884

1297
00:50:32,104 --> 00:50:33,194
They're all doing well.

1298
00:50:33,204 --> 00:50:33,654
Nobody.

1299
00:50:34,654 --> 00:50:35,064
Yeah,

1300
00:50:35,394 --> 00:50:35,994

1301
00:50:35,994 --> 00:50:36,184

1302
00:50:38,004 --> 00:50:38,614
Yeah.

1303
00:50:40,324 --> 00:50:42,934
That's what people do.

1304
00:50:42,944 --> 00:50:43,534
Yeah,

1305
00:50:43,764 --> 00:50:44,024
