00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.750
We're talking.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:10.750
We're talking.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.350
Don't worry.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.360
We have got to,

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.340
um We had gotten to,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.230
um you got to the point where we're starting to talk about we had gotten to the point where we're starting to talk about,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.740
um,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.880
about your children.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.250
He talked a little bit about where you grew up,

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.760
about your children.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.250
You talked a little bit about where you grew up.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.370
and then the point in your life where you were starting to have children.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.180
Many you mentioned that you had?

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.340
And then the point in your life where you were starting to have children.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.160
You mentioned that you had.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.150
No.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.300
He had three of them at the time,

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.740
and then another one came a little bit later.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.540
So that's where you want.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.290
If you had three of them at the time,

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.710
and then another one came a little bit later.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.160
So no,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.530
if you want.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.550
If that's where you want.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.100
Yeah.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.780
I think that's a good place to start,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.240
I think.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.890
Pick back up.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.750
Just Are you okay?

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.850
Oh,

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.740
So,

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.850
when they first moved to Gunderson,

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.040
it was in the in the fall.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.720
no.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.000
In the fall 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.640
on,

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.080
then my older And then my oldest,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.670
my first boy was born in September,

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.610
a boy was born in number.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.150
Okay?

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.240
and then we had to And then we have to make it through that winter.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.870
It was really,

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.190
really cold at winner.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.690
But he did all right.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.890
make it through the winter with really,

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.150
really cold winter.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.680
He did all right.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.520
And my dad and my granddad were so excited because we 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:16.530
had a boy I have my dad like,

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.280
Grandad were so excited because the other boy 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.830
and,

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.560
uh so so But we did all right.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.760
And then the second year,

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:26.580
we But we did all right.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.780
And then the second year,

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.810
we I think it was a cord.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.120
The end of the second year.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.800
We way build a house and moved in out of the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.360
trailer.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.150
I have no idea what happened to the trailer.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.600
I think it was toward the end of the second year way build a 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.310
house and moved in our trailer.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.050
I have no idea what happened to the trail.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.570
Let any way way But anyway,

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.090
we,

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.450
uh we will did to this house,

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.860
and that was it was kind of needed.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:44.480
It was a one bedroom to bedroom we moved into this house.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.330
It was a one bedroom,

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.440
too upstairs in a full mason,

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.320
which was made into an apartment which we,

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.840
uh,

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.710
we read it.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.300
Finally.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.440
upstairs in a full basement,

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.150
which was made into apartment with three.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.690
We read it,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.010
But it was it was a pretty pretty neat.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.760
but it was it was for the party.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.250
The only problem with with it wasthe that The only problem was with it Waas that 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.320
the,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.680
uh,

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.240
the,

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.550
uh,

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.850
basement basement and the sewer system that when build in 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.500
Gunnison was probably round the turn of the century and the sewer system when building guns was probably around the turn of the century.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:18.150
Okay.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.180
and it was what they call open sewer.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.510
And it was what they call open.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.850
Okay,

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.550
And so so and the water table get above the sewer,

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.180
their sewer,

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.010
it don't work,

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.600
the water table get above the store,

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.020
this tour and don't work.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.840
Okay.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.820
Okay.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.240
And so that's what happened in the spring because the snow would melt a lot 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.690
of that.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.090
Then,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.280
So what happened,

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.930
Frank?

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.420
Because snow would melt.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.870
Yeah,

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.640
allow that.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.520
at that point,

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.110
you got you got a real problem in the basement trying to get it to 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.420
flush and all that,

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.500
At that point,

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.710
you got a real problem.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.790
but,

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.280
uh,

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.680
What?

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.450
and it was a problem,

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.110
a lot.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.090
And there was nothing they could do about it,

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.000
And it was a a lot.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.850
They're nothing like d'oh.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.590
except to replace the whole sewer system,

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.330
Except replace the whole sources,

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.830
right?

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.780
Sure,

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.940
they probably have you done yet which they probably haven't done yet.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.880
I wouldn't I wouldn't think,

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:01.310
uh,

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.060
would.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.650
Anyway,

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.130
we,

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.230
uh it turned out really well,

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:02.670
and date away?

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.090
We,

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.330
uh,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.210
turned out rather well.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.960
I,

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:07.380
uh,

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:06.770
I brought a Oh,

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.180
yeah,

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.640
I brought the a wielding welding that 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.260
had been used for menus or trucks where it was trucks where 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.010
Ah,

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.480
no gas trucks.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.250
gas Actually,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.030
like,

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.880
actually like uh,

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.140
you they call it Elfi Gas.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.780
There we go.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.820
Oh,

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.230
you right.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.730
We call it fake.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.670
Here we go.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.590
Elfi Gas trucks.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.390
You this?

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.710
L ve gas strokes and used this thing.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.590
And so they wanted to sell the building,

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600
and I bought that thing and then So they want to sell a building.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.810
And I bought that thing,

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.970
Moved it down there on the back.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.570
moved it down there on the back of our place.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.540
So it was It was a big,

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.450
big building.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.820
And eventually I made it into a shopping,

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.960
then into a business.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.740
And we had all the repair business back there.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.270
It was a late late will.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.430
Eventually,

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.000
I waded into job into a business 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.910
way.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.170
Had all of repair business.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.680
But anyway,

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.640
But anyway,

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:00.430
uh,

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.620
there was a kind of an adventure with that because I went up.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.560
Thio didn't measure the building.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.800
They told me what the two inches were.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.130
there was kind of the venture with that because I went up to 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.520
did major building.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.420
They told me with.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.260
So then I made a foundation,

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.060
poured concrete,

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.660
did that.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.155
So So then I made a foundation and poured concrete.

00:04:17.155 --> 00:04:19.350
Did that went So yeah,

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.525
the And,

00:04:19.525 --> 00:04:21.315
uh we're doing infections that I would call Ah,

00:04:21.315 --> 00:04:21.825
I would do it.

00:04:21.825 --> 00:04:26.155
Infections and I would call ready mix,

00:04:26.155 --> 00:04:27.155
and they would cover.

00:04:27.295 --> 00:04:29.525
And I'd screed it and do it.

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:31.535
And then I'd make another section.

00:04:31.545 --> 00:04:26.270
So then already makes them.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.500
They would cover excreted do it.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.280
Then I make another faction will Then?

00:04:32.815 --> 00:04:34.185
then I moved about.

00:04:34.185 --> 00:04:35.665
They moved the building and well,

00:04:35.665 --> 00:04:34.206
the building was bigger than Then I moved about.

00:04:34.206 --> 00:04:38.756
They moved The building and loan building were bigger than a 

00:04:38.756 --> 00:04:43.576
foundation was hanging over about about 18.

00:04:39.065 --> 00:04:39.765
yeah,

00:04:40.485 --> 00:04:42.335
So it was hanging over Well,

00:04:42.455 --> 00:04:44.625
about 18 inches or so,

00:04:45.735 --> 00:04:47.045
which was really a problem.

00:04:47.055 --> 00:04:47.485
Yeah,

00:04:45.776 --> 00:04:46.506
We should really,

00:04:46.516 --> 00:04:47.006
bro.

00:04:47.016 --> 00:04:47.646
Yeah,

00:04:48.195 --> 00:04:53.165
but eventually was able to pour more concrete in there.

00:04:53.175 --> 00:04:54.115
Take care of that.

00:04:54.125 --> 00:04:55.435
But it turned out okay.

00:04:48.236 --> 00:04:53.186
but electorally was able to pour more concrete in there.

00:04:53.236 --> 00:04:54.126
Take care of that.

00:04:54.136 --> 00:04:55.446
But it turned out okay.

00:04:55.995 --> 00:04:57.985
And the building was a good one.

00:04:56.036 --> 00:04:57.926

Was kindergarten.

00:05:40.365 --> 00:05:41.035

00:05:42.065 --> 00:05:39.166
uh but it was allowed Start school,

00:05:39.166 --> 00:05:43.246
I guess with kindergarten and mother was 

00:05:46.565 --> 00:05:49.235
probably about six blocks away at least.

00:05:46.636 --> 00:05:48.366
right about six blocks away.

00:05:48.446 --> 00:05:48.736
Okay,

00:05:52.175 --> 00:05:52.885
And rough it.

00:05:53.595 --> 00:05:54.595
But hey,

00:05:54.595 --> 00:05:57.255
would walk the school even in the winter.

00:05:57.255 --> 00:05:59.105
Time was kind of neat,

00:05:59.115 --> 00:05:59.415

00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:01.085
I mean that the way they did things.

00:05:52.196 --> 00:05:52.746
I love that.

00:05:53.626 --> 00:05:54.606
But hey,

00:05:54.606 --> 00:05:56.446
would walk to school.

00:05:56.446 --> 00:05:57.306
Even the weather.

00:05:59.116 --> 00:05:59.876
I mean,

00:05:59.876 --> 00:06:01.416
That's why they did it.

00:06:02.575 --> 00:06:04.325
And so he started schooler,

00:06:02.736 --> 00:06:04.106

I heard that uh,

00:07:09.058 --> 00:07:10.248
if we were a teacher,

00:07:10.248 --> 00:07:10.658
you'd,

00:07:10.668 --> 00:07:11.438
you know,

00:07:11.438 --> 00:07:12.858

00:07:17.528 --> 00:07:18.128
you know,

00:07:15.856 --> 00:07:17.536

I fled with some were fishing,

00:07:24.316 --> 00:07:24.936
right?

00:07:22.758 --> 00:07:23.168
well,

00:07:23.168 --> 00:07:25.498
it never turned out that way.

00:07:26.388 --> 00:07:29.438
But that's that was my father's time.

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:31.198
That that was And 

00:07:31.198 --> 00:07:31.958
eventually,

00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:32.218
I,

00:07:32.228 --> 00:07:32.678
uh,

00:07:32.688 --> 00:07:35.078
and I work for the four service for a while.

00:07:35.088 --> 00:07:33.826
But then and eventually I worked with four.

00:07:33.836 --> 00:07:35.076
Federer's for a while,

00:07:35.156 --> 00:07:38.896
But then then I graduated,

00:07:38.896 --> 00:07:40.336
and I needed a job,

00:07:40.416 --> 00:07:37.068
So then,

00:07:37.078 --> 00:07:37.638
uh,

00:07:37.888 --> 00:07:40.388
I graduated and I needed a job,

00:07:40.398 --> 00:07:42.368
so Ah,

00:07:42.598 --> 00:07:45.838
I did got a job in Carlsbad,

00:07:45.838 --> 00:07:46.698
New Mexico.

00:07:42.656 --> 00:07:45.076
I got a job.

00:07:45.086 --> 00:07:47.968
Carl said the ration co So anyway,

00:07:47.968 --> 00:07:50.788
that we then we moved to Carl Bedwell.

00:07:47.366 --> 00:07:50.006
So any way moved to Carl?

00:07:50.016 --> 00:07:50.236
Well,

00:07:50.246 --> 00:07:52.398
well Uh,

00:07:51.866 --> 00:07:52.226
Oh,

00:07:54.006 --> 00:07:55.766
So they're one year,

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:56.838
and so were there one year on,

00:07:56.838 --> 00:07:58.618
then went to Roswell,

00:07:58.618 --> 00:07:59.408
New Mexico,

00:07:59.418 --> 00:08:00.698
for several years.

00:08:00.708 --> 00:07:58.526
For Roger.

00:07:58.526 --> 00:07:59.016
All right,

00:07:59.026 --> 00:08:00.726
go for earlier.

00:08:01.888 --> 00:08:03.998
what's the New Mexico military?

00:08:02.056 --> 00:08:06.838
It's a New Mexico military Like a long story 

00:08:06.838 --> 00:08:07.288
Short,

00:08:07.298 --> 00:08:07.628
right.

00:08:08.248 --> 00:08:08.588
Oh,

00:08:08.598 --> 00:08:08.978
my.

00:08:05.466 --> 00:08:08.876
looks like the long story Short like a lie.

00:08:09.678 --> 00:08:12.188
All those three grew up nicely.

00:08:09.666 --> 00:08:12.116
Although three grew up nicely.

00:08:13.488 --> 00:08:14.068
And,

00:08:14.068 --> 00:08:14.066
uh and so And,

00:08:14.076 --> 00:08:14.426
uh,

00:08:14.926 --> 00:08:16.983
So the question is,

00:08:16.983 --> 00:08:19.003
what happened to the word they go on?

00:08:19.003 --> 00:08:19.173
Well,

00:08:19.173 --> 00:08:20.563
that we grow up.

00:08:16.116 --> 00:08:16.966
the question is,

00:08:16.986 --> 00:08:17.946
what happened to you?

00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:22.093
Wherever you go throw And of course,

00:08:22.093 --> 00:08:22.943
in the meantime,

00:08:22.943 --> 00:08:23.433
we have.

00:08:25.653 --> 00:08:29.763
we eventually went toe a Manhattan Kansas on Duh.

00:08:25.766 --> 00:08:27.866
we never actually went toe Manhattan,

00:08:27.876 --> 00:08:28.576
Kansas.

00:08:30.793 --> 00:08:31.576
And why Why,

00:13:52.799 --> 00:13:53.709
four door.

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:59.500
And then we build a place around a 

00:13:59.500 --> 00:13:54.929
fence around there so that Yeah,

00:13:54.939 --> 00:13:59.909
that build up life around France 

00:13:59.909 --> 00:14:00.609
around there.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.580
chicken would get out.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:04.570
You know?

00:14:01.979 --> 00:14:03.779
Chicken would get out,

00:14:03.789 --> 00:14:04.289
you know?

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:05.510

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.609
you chase the kids he would get on the Are you chasing kids?

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.240

uh,

00:14:13.699 --> 00:14:14.179
And,

Hey,

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:18.509
running after all night?

00:14:21.795 --> 00:14:22.475
so I thought,

00:14:22.475 --> 00:14:22.895
Hey,

00:14:22.895 --> 00:14:23.285

00:14:21.899 --> 00:14:22.469
So I said,

00:14:22.479 --> 00:14:22.919
hey,

00:14:22.929 --> 00:14:23.319

00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:28.569
all you have to do people picked him from 

00:14:29.199 --> 00:14:30.285
when he traced them to win the Let's keep the chicken from getting when he faces them,

00:14:30.285 --> 00:14:35.025
get their wings up like this and they would run.

00:14:35.135 --> 00:14:36.095
And so,

00:14:36.505 --> 00:14:36.865
look,

00:14:36.865 --> 00:14:39.735
it was just taken hold of wings in.

00:14:33.349 --> 00:14:34.889
and they run.

00:14:35.429 --> 00:14:39.610

00:14:42.705 --> 00:14:43.855
I can't do anything.

00:14:44.335 --> 00:14:44.625
Yeah,

00:14:44.635 --> 00:14:45.285

I have you Right?

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:49.515

00:14:49.515 --> 00:14:52.335
was big and I had it in like this and he went on a bit.

00:14:52.345 --> 00:14:51.340
Rommel it like they were big like this,

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.990
and he went out with one lip.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:55.880
Yeah.

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:01.100
Anyway,

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.970
then Robin got dogs.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:03.590
Okay,

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.090
along In the meantime,

00:14:53.725 --> 00:14:55.745
and it's still there today.

00:14:56.445 --> 00:14:59.225
Still a big star there today,

00:15:00.605 --> 00:15:01.105
Anyway,

00:15:01.105 --> 00:15:03.015
Then Robin got dogs.

00:15:03.625 --> 00:15:05.105
And on the meantime,

00:15:06.135 --> 00:15:06.745
uh,

00:15:06.755 --> 00:15:08.765
this is fairly decent story.

00:15:08.765 --> 00:15:08.880
I guess this is a fairly decent story.

00:15:09.815 --> 00:15:10.690
the neighbors The neighbors,

00:15:12.415 --> 00:15:14.095
have the neighbors next to us,

00:15:14.315 --> 00:15:13.990
and then they were on the corner the neighbors next to us.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.190
And then they were on the corner,

00:15:17.825 --> 00:15:22.485
and they had a swimming pool there in the back that somebody had felt poorly,

00:15:22.485 --> 00:15:23.215
badly,

00:15:23.955 --> 00:15:26.435
where it was a big bills of lake swimming pool,

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.580
and they had a slumming pool back.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.890
Nobody will.

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:22.440
Yeah,

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:24.180
okay.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:27.885
It was a big building and,

00:15:27.885 --> 00:15:28.145
uh,

00:15:28.155 --> 00:15:30.165
but it was ground level.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:30.040
And what it was ground low.

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:36.650
So anyway,

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:42.460
they had a flood tonight around 1955.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:43.690

00:15:48.235 --> 00:15:49.845
the whole downtown home.

00:15:49.945 --> 00:15:51.505
It's a very good sized town,

00:15:52.085 --> 00:15:55.645
and it was at least that day defund in town.

00:15:55.995 --> 00:15:56.345
And,

00:15:56.345 --> 00:15:56.685
of course,

00:15:56.685 --> 00:15:47.640
the house We had had a basement downtown,

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.410

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.490
At least I did deep on in town.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:56.340
And,

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:56.700
of course,

00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:01.125
the house we had had a bracelet and it flooded that mason 

00:16:02.015 --> 00:16:06.295
and there was mud mud still over the ceiling in the races.

00:16:06.425 --> 00:16:09.725
And all that which we cleaned off,

00:16:09.735 --> 00:16:12.045
made room stuff down there.

00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:13.075
But anyway,

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:00.760
flooded that.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:01.870

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:11.530
which we cleaned off room stuff.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.090
But anyway,

00:16:13.715 --> 00:16:18.315
it had raised the level of the yard it had raised the level of the yard so that the 

00:16:18.325 --> 00:16:22.945
sidewalk was had one level and the ground was like that.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.550
so that the sidewalk was at one level,

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:25.380
ground way.

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:27.110
Take care of that.

00:16:23.919 --> 00:16:24.649
So we said,

00:16:24.649 --> 00:16:24.949
Well,

00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:27.279
we don't take care of that.

00:16:29.099 --> 00:16:31.529
My older son and I decided we would.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:30.900
You're fired.

00:16:32.179 --> 00:16:32.919

In a way,

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.060
there was a loaf life in the back.

00:16:41.569 --> 00:16:42.769
That's perfect place.

00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:46.229
And just take the level of the yard.

00:16:46.229 --> 00:16:47.829
We'll put it in this low place,

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.800
That's perfect place.

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:45.010
Just take a little of that.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.910
Your heart put it in this low foot.

00:16:48.399 --> 00:16:49.299

00:16:49.699 --> 00:16:49.230
And there's one nod from months Wait for the deal.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:54.559
And that's when on for much and we're filing up the yard 

00:16:54.559 --> 00:16:57.049
where it was down a free good side yard,

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.650
We finally got the yard where it was down free time,

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:57.040

00:17:00.529 --> 00:17:05.379
Got it down where it was Go got it down where it was level with the sidewalk and 

00:17:05.379 --> 00:17:06.579
then we replanted.

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:07.569
Turned out good.

00:17:07.999 --> 00:17:08.489

That's smart,

00:48:35.537 --> 00:48:35.737
though.

00:48:36.357 --> 00:48:38.127
Supposed to be the good investment.

the RV parks on the way to go.

00:49:04.207 --> 00:49:08.677
Suppose the RV parks are the way to go because all you have to do is rent out the space.

00:49:08.687 --> 00:49:10.547
They have to provide everything else.

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:10.530
So we have to do is rent out the space they they have to provide everything else.

00:49:11.177 --> 00:49:11.517
And,

00:49:11.517 --> 00:49:11.827
uh,

00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:11.430
I'm,

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.287
uh guess it's a lot easier.

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:13.230
guess it's a lot easier.

00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:14.770
Yeah.

00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:15.300

00:49:16.497 --> 00:49:17.017
Well,

00:49:17.077 --> 00:49:17.847
in this case,

00:49:19.547 --> 00:49:20.137
yeah,

00:49:20.777 --> 00:49:25.197

Yeah.

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:17.000
Well,

00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:17.830
in this case,

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:19.410
you have new maintenance stuff.

00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:20.080

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:25.460

00:49:32.187 --> 00:49:33.687
they get some of that.

00:49:33.807 --> 00:49:35.087
You think they're going wrong?

00:49:35.087 --> 00:49:35.487
